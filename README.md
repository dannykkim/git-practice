## Project Overview
This project was inspired by common struggle of deciding on a meal. The program randomly recommends a menu based on user preferences, making it easier to choose a meal.

**(However, based on actual use of the program...)**
Most users either keep running the program until the desired menu is displayed
or end up eating what they originally wanted 999% of the time.
